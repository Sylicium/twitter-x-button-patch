# twitter-x-button-patch
 A patch for the X button of twitter not working
 **This is a Chrome(/chromium core) only extension !**
 For now, there is no planed coding for a firefox or other extensions.

# Why this extension ?
 All began with that issue on Twitter algorihtm: https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm/issues/1876

# Keep in mind !
 This is my first ever built extension, so it might be really bad or glitchy, so be gentle and feel free to drop me [issues about bugs](https://github.com/Sylicium/twitter-x-button-patch/issues)
